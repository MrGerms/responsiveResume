# responsiveResume
Simple Resume in a Responsive Grid. 

Completed: responsive grid and CSS.

Improvements: Need to improve media queries between 481 and 1150 pixels. Responsive grid allows text to hit right/left sides. This was actually the original intent, however upon review I would like a small margin or padding as a border.

TODO's: 
  1) Create contact modal window and connect twilio.
  2) Add some CSS and JS pizazz. Image/icon resize on hover, hero background image refocus when hovering name, etc.  
  3) Add a custom database / CMS backend. 
  
 Unsure:
  1) Menu
  2) Link to portfolio page
  3) Link to background projects page
