responsiveResume

Simple Resume in a Responsive Grid.

Completed: responsive grid and CSS.

TODO's:

    1) Need to improve media queries between 481 and 1150 pixels. Responsive grid allows text to hit right/left sides. This was actually my original intent, however upon review I would like a small margin or padding as a border.
    2) Need to add a link to this github page
    5) Add some CSS and JS pizazz. Image/icon resize on hover, hero background image refocus when hovering name, etc.
    6) Add instructional note on included config files, or maybe leave in a version with sensitive variables set to null

Unsure:

    1) Menu
    2) Link to portfolio page
    3) Link to background projects page
    4) Add a custom database / CMS backend for config settings and maybe content updates.

Completed, Alpha phase, watch for bugs
    1) Added google recaptcha
    2) Created contact modal window and connect twilio.
