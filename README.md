## Project: responsiveResume

*** Simple Resume in a Responsive Grid with Twilio Contact ***

### TODO's:

1. Need some fine tuning on Responsive media queries. Footer, .skills area, headers in history area
2. Need to add a link to this github page
3. Add some CSS and JS pizazz. Image/icon resize on hover, hero background image refocus when hovering name, etc.
4. Add instructional note on included config files, or maybe leave in a version with sensitive variables set to null
5. Convert to SASS

Unsure, might add in the future:
- Menu, I honestly don't want to add this but might for UI/UE demonstration
- Link to portfolio page
- Link to background projects / Currently working on page
- Add a custom database / CMS backend for config settings and maybe content updates.
- Blog for interesting problems I come across
- Sales page for freelance work


Completed:
+ responsive grid CSS
+ Added modal window for contact form
+ Added google recaptcha to contact form
+ Added Twilio connection to contact form
+ Added SS verification for above inputs
+ Added Parsley js verification to contact form
+ Improve media queries between 481 and 1150 pixels and stopped text hitting sides.
